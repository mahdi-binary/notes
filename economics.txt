The Supply and Demand Model

	* Price: The amount of money or other goods that one must pay to obtain a particular good.

	* Demand: A relationship between price and quantity demanded.
		** Quantity Demanded: The quantity of a good that people want to buy at a given price during a specific time period.
		** Demand Schedule: A tabular presentation of demand showing the price and quantity demanded for a particular good, all else being equal. Below is an example of a demand schedule for bicycles.
		** Law of Demand: The tendency for the quantity demanded of a good in a market to decline as its price rises.
		** Demand Curve: A graph of demand showing the down-ward sloping relationship between price and quanity demanded. Below is an example of a demand curve for bicycles, showing shifts of the demand curve versus movements along the demand curve.

	* Supply: A relationship between price and quantity supplied.
		** Quantity Supplied: The quantity of a good that firms are willing to sell at a given price.
		** Supply Schedule: A tabular presentation of supply showing the price and quantity supplied of a particular good, all else being equal. Below is an example of a supply schedule for bicycles.
		** Law of Supply: The tendence for the quantity supplied of a good in a market to increase a its price rises.
		** Supply Curve: A graph of supply showing the upward-sloping relationship between price and quantity supplied. Below is an example of a supply curve for bicycles, showing shifts of versus movements along the supply curve.

	* Shortage (excess demand): A situation in which quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied.
	* Surplus (excess supply): A situation in which quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded.
	* Equilibrium Price: The price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.
	* Equilibrium Quantity: The quantity traded at the equilibrium price.
	* Market Equilibrium: The situation in which the price is equal to the equilibrium price and the quantity traded equals the equilibrium quantity. The figure below shows a market equilibrium.

	* Elastic Demand: demand for which the price elasticity is greater than 1.
	* Inelastic Demand: demand for which the price elasticity is less than 1.

	* Unit-Free Measure: a measure that does not depend on a unit of measurement.
	
	* Price Elasticity of Demand: the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good divided by the percentage change in the price of that good.
	* Price Elasticity of Supply: the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.
		** Perfectly Elastic Demand: demand for which the price elasticity is infinite, indicating an infinite response to a change in price and therefore a horizontal demand curve.
		** Perfectly Elastic Supply: supply for which the price elasticity is infinite, indicating an infinite response of quantity supplied to a change in price and therefore a horizontal supply curve.
		** Perfectly Inelastic Demand: demand for which the price elasticity is zero, indicating no response to a change in price and therefore a vertical demand curve.
		** Perfectly Inelastic Supply: supply for which the price elasticity is zero, indicating no response of quantity supplied to a change in price and therefore a vertical supply curve.

	* Price Control: a government law or regulation that sets or limits the price to be charged for a particular good.
		** Price Ceiling: a government price control that sets the maximum allowable price for a good.
			# Rent Control: a government price control that sets the maximum allowable rent on a house or apartment.
		** Price Floor: a government price control that sets the minimum allowable price for a good.
			# Minimum Wage: a wage per hour below which it is illegal to pay workers.
