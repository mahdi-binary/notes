Networking Notes
============================================

* Packet messaging

* Layered Network Model:
A layered approach allowed the problem of designing a network to be broken into more manageable sub problems.

* TCP/IP "Internet Protocol Suite"
- Application Layer: Web, E-Mail, File Transfer  
-- Port
-- nmap
-- Application protocols: http, ftp, mail, etc.
--- Web: http
--- GET URL


- Transport Layer (TCP): Reliable Connections
-- keep copy of data to get acknowledgement
-- “too long” send it again

- Internet Network Layer (IP): Simple, Unreliable
-- Worldwide number addresses
-- 1-255.1-255.1-255.1-255
-- 141.25.*.*:which network
-- NAT (Network Address Translation)
-- Trace-route
-- TTL
-- Domain Name System
--- Like post letter system

- Link Layer (Ethernet, WiFi): Physical Connections
-- Serial numbers(physical address): For only one hop 

* OSI (Open System Interconnection Model): 7 layer

* Encryption and Confidentiality

- secret-key

Alice { Plain text =encrypt=> Cipher Text } -> Message Might be Intercepted -> Bob { Chiper Test =decrypt=> Plain text }

-- Cryptographic Hash
   Input =cryptographic hash function=> digest
--- sha1
--- md5

- public-key

- public-key
